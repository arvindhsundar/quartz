## What is a marketing plan?
A Marketing Plan is a plan to make money from your business. It is the blueprint of your [[Marketing Engines]] and first step in your [[Marketing]] journey.

## Points To Remember
- Your marketing plan doesn't have to be detailed, but it's important that you write it down somewhere.
- Your marketing plan can (and probably would) overlap with other parts of your business and other disciplines. That's ok. [[Marketing]] is a huge field.
- You don't have to get it perfect. The planning is important. The plan is secondary.

## Building a marketing plan
To build a good marketing plan, you need to think through different aspects of your business and understand how they all work together.

At its core, a marketing plan needs:

1. A solid understanding of your customer, their problems and how you fit into that dynamic
2. An offer that you can make your customers
3. Key Messages that you can use to get your customer's attention
4. Funnels to help you sell your offers 

There are many ways to build your marketing plan, but I recommend using [[The Game Plan]] as the first step.

Once you've filled out [[The Game Plan]], you can write out your Epic Story. The Epic Story is the workhorse of your entire [[Marketing Plan]] and you will use it in all aspects of your [[Marketing]] efforts.

## What is The Epic Story?

The Epic Story is a template for you to tell the story of your business. You will use it to talk about your business to customers, make marketing content - tweets, videos, sales pages, blog posts, threads, copywriting stuff - and invariably, plan out your business strategy. It goes like this:

## The Structure of The Epic Story

The Hero lives in a Broken World - a world that’s been plagued by Monsters. The Hero has tried fixing their Broken World, but has not been successful.

One day, a Guide (with Superpowers!) arrives in the Hero’s world and presents an adventure - a way out of The Broken World and into Paradise. The Hero accepts and sets out with The Guide.  

Armed with The Guide’s Weapons & guidance, the Hero goes on to fight Monsters, complete Quests and Level Up. Along the way, they gain Loot and eventually, upon the end of their adventure, reach the Paradise they set out for.

## The Epic Story in Business

Converted to a business context, The Epic Story looks like this:

Your customer is unhappy with their current state of affairs. They’ve been trying to make a change, but their problems and obstacles are holding them back.

One day, they find you and discover your offer. They’re hesitant initially, but later, after gaining trust in you and understanding why you’re doing what you’re doing, they buy in and take your help.

With your help, your customers discover a new way of doing things, expanding their network and meeting others on the same journey as them. 

They solve their problems, gain experience and earn things they value. They acquire new skills, and make progress in their journey, hitting important milestones along the way. Ultimately, they address the underlying problems and undergo a transformation - building the life they want.

## After The Epic Story
Once you have your epic story, you need to build out your Offer, identify your Key Messages and build your Funnels.

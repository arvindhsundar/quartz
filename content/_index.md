Heya!

I'm Arvindh Sundar.

I'm a former CMO & 3x founder helping founders build powerful [[Marketing Engines]].

I do this using my insights from my past experience in startups, growth & consulting.

I make videos, sketchnotes and send a daily email with a single tip.

Get in touch with me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/arvindhsundar).

Prior to my current work, I was the CMO of an edtech startup. In the past, I've started 3 companies, including a content marketing agency (Grok Communications), a training outfit (The Way Of The Octopus) and a personal development academy (Blue Lotus Training).

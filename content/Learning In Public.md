Learning in public is a parallel to building in public.

I think of it as building a personal knowledge mesh that connects all the things I've learned. These can form new connections and lead to interesting discoveries.

Another benefit is that this peels away the need for 'performance' while interacting in public. All you gotta do is be who you are.

It is the blueprint of your [[Marketing Engines]] and first step in your [[Marketing]] journey.\n\n## Points To Remember\n- Your marketing plan doesn't have to be detailed, but it's important that you write it down somewhere.\n- Your marketing plan can (and probably would) overlap with other parts of your business and other disciplines. That's ok. [[Marketing]] is a huge field.\n- You don't have to get it perfect. The planning is important. The plan is secondary.\n\n## Building a marketing plan\nTo build a good marketing plan, you need to think through different aspects of your business and understand how they all work together.\n\nAt its core, a marketing plan needs:\n\n1. A solid understanding of your customer, their problems and how you fit into that dynamic\n2. An offer that you can make your customers\n3. Key Messages that you can use to get your customer's attention\n4. Funnels to help you sell your offers \n\nThere are many ways to build your marketing plan, but I recommend using [[The Game Plan]] as the first step.\n\n---\n### To Do\n- [ ] Create notes on each step of the building a marketing plan process\n- [ ] Link to free video course","lastmodified":"2023-04-10T08:06:18.301149389Z","tags":["marketing","plan"]},"/The-Epic-Story":{"title":"The Epic Story","content":"Once you've filled out [[The Game Plan]], you can write out your Epic Story. The Epic Story is the workhorse of your entire [[Marketing Plan]] and you will use it in all aspects of your [[Marketing]] efforts.\n\n## What is The Epic Story?\n\nThe Epic Story is a template for you to tell the story of your business. You will use it to talk about your business to customers, make marketing content - tweets, videos, sales pages, blog posts, threads, copywriting stuff - and invariably, plan out your business strategy. It goes like this:\n\n## The Structure of The Epic Story\n\nThe Hero lives in a Broken World - a world that’s been plagued by Monsters. The Hero has tried fixing their Broken World, but has not been successful.\n\nOne day, a Guide (with Superpowers!) arrives in the Hero’s world and presents an adventure - a way out of The Broken World and into Paradise. The Hero accepts and sets out with The Guide.  \n\nArmed with The Guide’s Weapons \u0026 guidance, the Hero goes on to fight Monsters, complete Quests and Level Up. Along the way, they gain Loot and eventually, upon the end of their adventure, reach the Paradise they set out for.\n\n## The Epic Story in Business\n\nConverted to a business context, The Epic Story looks like this:\n\nYour customer is unhappy with their current state of affairs. They’ve been trying to make a change, but their problems and obstacles are holding them back.\n\nOne day, they find you and discover your offer. They’re hesitant initially, but later, after gaining trust in you and understanding why you’re doing what you’re doing, they buy in and take your help.\n\nWith your help, your customers discover a new way of doing things, expanding their network and meeting others on the same journey as them. \n\nThey solve their problems, gain experience and earn things they value. They acquire new skills, and make progress in their journey, hitting important milestones along the way. Ultimately, they address the underlying problems and undergo a transformation - building the life they want.\n\n## After The Epic Story\nOnce you have your epic story, you need to build out your Offer, identify your Key Messages and build your Funnels.\n\n---\n### To Do\n- [ ] Connect the different steps of the marketing plan to their notes.","lastmodified":"2023-04-10T08:06:18.301149389Z","tags":["marketing","plan","storytelling","messaging"]},"/The-Game-Plan":{"title":"The Game Plan","content":"\n## What is The Game Plan?\nThe Game Plan is a one page document that you fill out to understand how your customer, their problems and your solution all fit together. It's at the heart of building a profitable business, the core of your [[Marketing]] and the first step in building a [[Marketing Plan]].\n\nI built [[The Game Plan]] based on my 15+ years of marketing experience, my Master's Degree from Manchester Business School, rigorous study of The Hero's Journey and the study of the way games - particularly roleplaying games, are designed. It is the tool I've used to help all my consulting and workshop clients.\n\n## How does The Game Plan work?\nThe Game Plan reframes your business as an epic adventure.\n\n\u003eIn this adventure, your customers are heroes trying to escape a broken world and trying to get to paradise. In this context, your job is to be the guide who gives the hero the weapons they need to defeat the monsters in the way. \n\nThough similar frameworks like The Hero's Journey, Storybrand and The Writer's Journey exist, I found that they fell short when it came to my needs in marketing and business. They did not factor in the dynamic nature of the business and the changing needs of the customer along the customer's journey.\n\n## How do you use The Game Plan?\nYou can download The Game Plan from the link at the bottom of this note and follow along.\n\nThe Game Plan has 10 elements that each have a corresponding business element. You need to capture your answers to these questions to:\n1. Thoroughly understand what your business is all about\n2. Be able to tell others about your business (starting with [[The Epic Story]])\n3. Proceed with your [[Marketing Plan]]\n\nThe 10 elements of The Game Plan, and their corresponding business elements are:\n\n1. The Hero: Who is your customer?\n2. The Broken World: What is the status quo – the current state of affairs that makes your customer unhappy?\n3. Monsters: What are the problems, pains, frustrations, unmet needs and unmet desires that make your customer feel miserable?\n4. The Guide: Who are you?\n5. The Weapons: What are the content, products, services, systems \u0026 other things you can give your customer that will help solve their problems?\n6. The Guide's Superpower: What sets you apart from everyone else who can help your customer?\n7. Quests: What are the things your customer needs to do to solve their problems?\n8. Level Up: How does your customer transform internally and externally by completing the Quests?\n9. Loot: What valuable things does your customer get by completing the tasks and making progress?\n10. Paradise: What does your customer’s perfect world look like - a world where they have no problem, pain or frustration?\n\n\n## Download The Game Plan\n\nTo download The Game Plan, go [here](https://www.PutThePlayerFirst.com/gameplan).\n\n---\n### To Do\n- [ ] Notes for each element of The Game Plan\n- [ ] Flesh out content for the free video course","lastmodified":"2023-04-10T08:06:18.301149389Z","tags":["marketing","plan"]}}
